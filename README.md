# BikeRental
Bike Rental Prediction Model using Python and Angular

This project predicts the cost of bike rentals based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and wind speed using **Python** and **Linear Regression**. The goal is to showcase how machine learning can be used to provide valuable insights for bike rental systems.

# Project Overview

The project involves a simple web application built with **Angular** on the frontend and a **Flask API** on the backend. The Flask API uses a trained **Linear Regression model** to predict the rental cost of bikes based on temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Users input these environmental factors into the Angular frontend, and the backend returns the predicted cost.

# Features
  
  - Predicts bike rental cost based on environmental factors.
  - Simple and interactive UI built with **Angular**.
  - Backend API developed using **Flask** to handle user input and return predictions.
  - **Machine Learning** model trained on a dataset of 700+ entries.

# Technologies Used
  
  - **Python**: Backend logic, model training, and Flask API.
  - **Flask**: Web framework for the Python backend.
  - **Angular**: Frontend for capturing user input and displaying predictions.
  - **scikit-learn**: For building and training the linear regression model.
  - **NumPy**: For handling numerical computations.
  - **HTML/CSS**: For basic frontend styling.
  - **CSV**: Data stored in CSV format, used for training the model.
